Python is famous because it support all programming paradigm

what is object and why it is imp?
In real world everything we use is an object. 
Object will have attributes and behaviour.
As a object we do something and store something.

What are methods?
This are similar to functions called as objects in OOPs.

Why classes are important?
It is important because it gives a design of object.
Which we can use to create so many instances i.e. objects.

 Every object has his own variables and own methods which work together

 __init__ is a constructor

 Every time we create object it take some space different for different objects.

 self is important to work with current object i.e. with current instance.
